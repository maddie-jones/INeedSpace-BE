        Kentaurus is the bright star near the top of this broad southern skyscape.
        Of course it''s probably better known as Alpha Centauri, nearest star system
        to the Sun. Below it sprawls a dark nebula complex. The obscuring interstellar
        dust clouds include Sandqvist catalog clouds 169 and 172 in silhouette against
        the rich starfields along the southern Milky Way. Rigil Kent is a mere 4.37
        light-years away, but the dusty dark nebulae lie at the edge of the starforming
        Circinus-West molecular cloud about 2,500 light-years distant. The wide-field
        of view spans over 12 degrees (24 full moons) across southern skies.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/1904/sandqvist169_colombari.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Rigil
